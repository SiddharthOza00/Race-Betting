# Race-Betting

Do you like to betting on races? 
If no then good cause gambling is bad but if Yes here is your very own personal race to bet on.

There are different coloured turtles🐢 namely:- red, blue, yellow, purple, green, brown
When you run the code a dialog box opens where you can bet which coloured turtle you think is gonna win.
When enter your bet the turtles get arranged at their respective places and then off they go!
Do not worry they are not actual turtles🐢, the race won't take long.

If the turtle on which you bet on wins you WIN! If not then better luck next time


#Requirements to run the code

1)You need a 3.9 or above python interpreter to run the code.

2)I have used PyCharm to develop this game.



Enjoy!!
